        <h1>What is Littering?</h1>
        <p>
          Littering is the act of improperly disposing waste products or trash,
          such as on the streets or sidewalks. Examples of littering include
          food containers, bottles, napkins, and cigarette butts, which
          comprises 50% of littering in the world. image showing examples of
          littering (maybe some photos by self)

        <h2>Difference between littering and dumping</h2>
        <p>
          Littering is where small bits of garbage are disposed on roads or
          sidewalks. Unintentional littering occurs when garbage falls out of
          improperly secured vehicles or from overflowing dumpsters. Dumping, on
          the other hand, is the disposal of large amount of trash illegally
          (such as in empty lots instead of in a dumpster). Dumping also
          includes the disposal of hazardous material improperly.
